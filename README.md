# PatchMicrostrip-using-CST

The aim of this project is to implement a microstrip technology-based
microwave device (Antenna, power divider, or power coupler). in microstrip antennas,
it is mandatory to minimize the S-parameter (S11) at design frequency,
achieve certain antenna gain at a certain direction.
