# PatchMicrostrip-using-CST

The aim of this project is to implement a microstrip technology-based
microwave device (Antenna, power divider, or power coupler). The design
should be based on a well published paper (well cited), from 2017 to 2022.
Each team may select a paper from those attached to the declaration post or
find a more recent/interesting and implementable one. There exist many
design specifications for such devices. For example, in microstrip antennas,
it is mandatory to minimize the S-parameter (S11) at design frequency,
achieve certain antenna gain at a certain direction.
